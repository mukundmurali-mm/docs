Welcome to my personal space on the web! I'm Mukund Murali, a passionate technologist exploring the frontiers of Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence. This is where I share my journey, projects, and insights.

## About Me

I'm a Cloud Infrastructure Architect with extensive experience in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and Microsoft Azure. Currently, I'm diving deep into the world of AI, focusing on Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), and their application in building intelligent systems. My goal is to leverage my cloud expertise and growing AI toolkit to create innovative solutions that solve real-world problems.

I thrive on building and experimenting. Lately, I‚Äôve been developing AI-powered tools, such as chatbots using OCI Generative AI and vision models capable of translating cloud architecture diagrams into Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform). My approach combines robust product thinking with hands-on technical skills.

**Key Strengths**: OCI, Azure, LangChain, LLMs, Vector Databases, Terraform, DevSecOps, Network Architecture, and Strategic Project Delivery.

I'm always eager to connect with fellow enthusiasts in the AI and cloud domains. If you're building the next generation of infrastructure or intelligent applications, let's talk!
